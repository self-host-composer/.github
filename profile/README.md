## Hi there 👋


This organization contains my docker compose stacks that i selfhost.
I decided to do for different reasons. 
1. I want to force myself to clean them and order them.
2. I want to be able to restart my system easily if the worse were to happen
3. I want to maybe be abble to help people that want to copy this

I'l slowly create one repo per stack and add it in this organization.

### Why one repo per stack? 
I chosed one repo per stack so that I can simply donwload only the repo i need and deploy it without downloading too many things that I don't need.
