## Hi there 👋


This organization contains my docker compose stacks that i selfhost.
I decided to do for different reasons. 
1. I want to force myself to clean them and order them.
2. I want to be able to restart my system easily if the worse were to happen
3. I want to maybe be abble to help people that want to copy this

I'l slowly create one repo per stack and add it in this organization.

### Why one repo per stack? 
I chosed one repo per stack so that I can simply donwload only the repo i need and deploy it without downloading too many things that I don't need. 


Appart for the  .env-example file that i generate by hand I simply deploy them in a 3 step process with dockge https://github.com/louislam/dockge

Clone the desired repo into the dockge stacks folder. 

Go to dockge and fill the environment to your need.

Deploy!  🚀



The private stacks like nextcloud are exposed to me through  cloudflare tunnels and secured with github logins, the public ones like my ghost blog [danielpetrica.com](https://danielpetrica.com) are exposed through a traefik proxy.
